# COWS
Communication-band Optical Waveguide Simulator

A simple simulator thought for photonic circuits.

# Work In Progress
Currently starting the project, the current goal is to obtain a modular simulator capable of simulating isolated circuit components.

## Current focus
Plane waveguides
Thin-Film waveguides
Implementation of birefringent materials
Mach Zender Modulators
